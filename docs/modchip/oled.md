#### The Installation

This page will guide you through the modchip installation process on "Normal" model Switch consoles. Everything you need will be listed and pictures of what your solder joints should look like will be posted by each step.

#### Requirements:

- A soldering iron with a small(er) tip (preferably temperature controlled that can reach 350C consistently)
- Flux (preferably halogen free flux)
- Thermal paste (preferably non-conductive)
- Isopropyl Alcohol (preferably 95-99% IPA)
- Your modchip
- Kapton tape (optional, but recommended)
- A dental pick or other thin and sharp tool (to scrape away the top layer of the PCB for the B point)
- Toothpicks/Q tips (to remove the thermal paste between the capacitors)
- Soldering tin (leaded is recommended, unleaded will work depending on your skill level)
- A fume extractor (for your own health and safety)
- A microscope (optional but recommended)

#### Instructions:

1. Unscrew the Switch's backplate.

2. Remove the metal shield/cover (be careful with the antennas that are routed across the metal shield/cover).

3. Remove the Gamecard reader/SD card reader board.

4. Remove the heatpipe/heatsink.

5. Remove the IHS (Internal Heat Spreader) to expose the bare SoC die and RAM chips.

6. Remove and clean up the thermal paste on the SoC die and around/in-between the capacitors on the SoC using IPA.
       - You can also clean off the thermal paste between the IHS and heatpipe/heatsink in the meantime, the red-ish colored thermal goop between the heatpipe/heatsink and metal shield/cover can be left alone.

7. Remove the fan and unplug the fan ribbon cable, joycon rail ribbon cables, screen ribbon cable and speaker connectors.

8. Unscrew and remove the bottom bar of the shell.

9. Remove the motherboard from the Switch casing.

10. Remove the metal plate covering the eMMC chip on the back of the motherboard.

11. Turn the motherboard back around and scrape away the B point on the motherboard using a thin and sharp metal tool.
