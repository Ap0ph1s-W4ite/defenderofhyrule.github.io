#### The Installation

This page will guide you through the modchip installation process on "Normal" model Switch consoles. Everything you need will be listed and pictures of what your solder joints should look like will be posted by each step.

#### Requirements:

- A soldering iron with a small(er) tip (preferably temperature controlled that can reach 350C consistently)
- Flux (preferably halogen free flux)
- Thermal paste (preferably non-conductive)
- Isopropyl Alcohol (preferably 95-99% IPA)
- Your modchip (including the SoC ribbon cable)
- Kapton tape (optional, but recommended)
- Toothpicks/Q-tips (to remove the thermal paste between the capacitors on the SoC)
- Soldering tin (leaded is recommended, unleaded will work depending on your skill level)
- A fume extractor (for your own health and safety)
- A microscope (optional but recommended)

#### Instructions:

1. Unscrew the Switch's backplate.

2. Remove the SD card reader.

3. Remove the metal shield/cover.

4. Remove the heatpipe/heatsink.

5. Remove the IHS (Internal Heat Spreader) to expose the bare SoC die and RAM chips.

6. Remove and clean up the thermal paste on the SoC die and around/in-between the capacitors on the SoC using IPA.
       - You can also clean off the thermal paste between the IHS and heatpipe/heatsink in the meantime, the red-ish colored thermal goop between the heatpipe/heatsink and metal shield/cover can be left alone.

7. Remove (unplug) the eMMC module from the motherboard.

8. Ensure your working area is clean, you do *not* want to have thermal paste interfere with your soldering tin. This can also cause corrosion over time if you don't clean the area properly.

9. Pre-tin the pads labeled `SP1` and `SP2` on the SoC ribbon cable.

10. Place the SoC ribbon cable and align the ribbon cable with the capacitors on the SoC.

11. Tuck the anker points underneath the metal frame below the SoC and solder the ribbon cable down once lined up correctly.

12. Use your soldering iron and heat up the end of each capacitor together with the respective pad next to both ends of each capacitor of the `SP1` and `SP2` points, ensure the solder flows between the pad and on the ribbon cable and end of the capacitor.
